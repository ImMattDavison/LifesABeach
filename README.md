## Why we built Life's a Beach! üåä

PrideHacks should be all about celebrating and understanding LGBT+ identities. As someone who identifies as LGBT+ (Matt) I understand just how difficult some people can find it to understand LGBT+ identities, no matter how much they'd love to. I think it is incredibly important that good educational content is available to support people in learning about the people they love and those that matter around them.

Why Life's a Beach? Well Adam wanted it to have beaches, so there's beaches. _To add to this! Beaches are calm, relaxing places which I have found to be a serene place whenever I feel stressed, unwanted or unloved. I can sit on the sand or walk through the sea and feel at peace. ~ Adam_
